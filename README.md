# 🏎️ NEAT-based Car Simulation

This project uses the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to evolve neural networks that control cars in a simulation. The cars navigate a track and are evaluated based on their performance, with rewards for moving forward and avoiding crashes.

## ✨ Features
- 🚗 Simulate cars controlled by neural networks evolved using NEAT.
- 🗺️ Multiple maps with different car sizes and positions.
- 🖥️ User interface for selecting maps and starting the simulation.
- ⏱️ Real-time visualization of the simulation.
